# Notes

A simple repository for personal notes and experiments.

## Whatâ€™s here
- Quick notes, checklists, and snippets
- Small demos while learning Git/GitHub

## Commands I use often
```bash
git status
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"
git push
## Next steps
- [ ] Create a `todo.md`
- [ ] Try a new branch: `git switch -c feature/my-change`
- [ ] Open a pull request from that branch on GitHub
